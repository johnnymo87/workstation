{"id":"workstation-rhp","title":"Fix broken hooks symlink on devbox","description":"The ~/.claude/hooks symlink points to non-existent /home/dev/projects/dotfiles/.claude/hooks. This breaks automatic session registration and stop event notifications.\n\nContext:\n- Devbox used to have dotfiles repo which contained hooks\n- After migration to workstation repo, the symlink became dangling\n- Without hooks: sessions don't auto-register, stop events don't fire notifications\n- The /notify-telegram skill now works around this by manual registration, but stop notifications still won't work\n\nFix options:\n1. Add hooks to workstation repo and deploy via home-manager\n2. Create hooks in assets/claude/hooks/ similar to other assets\n3. Configure hooks in Claude Code settings.json instead of symlinks","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"jonathan.mohrbacher@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-21T15:37:19.266406971-05:00","created_by":"Jonathan Mohrbacher","updated_at":"2026-01-21T15:37:19.266406971-05:00"}
