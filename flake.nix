    # Build-level CI gate.
    #
    # `nix flake check` on its own is NOT a build gate for this repo. It
    # *evaluates* `nixosConfigurations` (drv level only) and does not even
    # evaluate `homeConfigurations` -- it just confirms the attrset exists. So a
    # derivation that is fine at eval time but fails at BUILD time sails through
    # CI green and only explodes later, on the user's machine, at `switch` time.
    #
    # That is not hypothetical. #211 added `source "${opencode-serve-auth-sh}"`
    # to three `writeShellApplication`s; that builder runs shellcheck with
    # findings treated as fatal, and shellcheck always emits SC1091 for a source
    # target it cannot resolve -- which a /nix/store path never is at lint time.
    # All three failed to build, taking `home-manager-generation` with them,
    # while CI reported success on both legs. It went unnoticed for a day, so
    # nothing from #211/#212 reached the box, which in turn silently invalidated
    # an unrelated measurement that was about to be acted on. Fixed in #215.
    #
    # Listing the configurations here makes `nix flake check` actually realise
    # them, locally and in CI, by the same command. Both NixOS hosts are
    # aarch64-linux (devbox is ARM on Hetzner, cloudbox is ARM on GCP), so the
    # ubuntu-24.04-arm leg builds all four. This is keyed per-system so the
    # x86_64 leg never tries to realise an aarch64 attribute.
    #
    # Deliberately absent:
    #
    #   nixos-cloudbox -- that host pulls in `claude-failover-proxy`, whose
    #     binary lives in a PRIVATE repo and is fetched through the GitHub API
    #     with a token supplied via `netrcImpureEnvVars`. A CI runner has no
    #     such credential, so the fetch 404s and the toplevel cannot be built
    #     there at all. This is a credential wall, not a defect: it was proven
    #     empirically in the first run of this gate (#218), where the other
    #     three checks built clean and only this one failed. Note the recurring
    #     hazard is unaffected -- `writeShellApplication` (the shellcheck-fatal
    #     builder) appears zero times in either host configuration and only in
    #     the home configs, which ARE built below. Cloudbox also keeps the
    #     eval-level checking `nix flake check` already did. Restoring a real
    #     build needs a CI credential; tracked separately.
    #
    #   darwinConfigurations -- needs a macOS builder. Tracked separately.
