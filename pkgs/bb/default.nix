# BuildBuddy CLI -- Bazelisk wrapper plus subcommands for BuildBuddy
# (login, view, download, ...). We use it primarily as a CLI surface to the
# BuildBuddy enterprise API; see assets/opencode/skills/using-buildbuddy for
# the bb-test-log workflow built on top.
#
# Upstream releases prebuilt binaries per OS/arch on GitHub. The binaries are
# statically-linked Go (verified with `ldd`: "not a dynamic executable"), so
# no autoPatchelfHook is needed -- a plain mkDerivation that drops the binary
# into $out/bin is sufficient on every platform.
#
# Auto-updated by .github/workflows/update-bb.yml (mirrors update-gws.yml).
